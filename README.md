# wsp2j
Web Scrapping Project 2 for Java (wsp2j). Automated locally hosted periodic website monitoring and logging using JSoup.

## Input Files

```target.list``` - Input Target List in CSV
* Required Fileds: 3 (Target Classification, Target ID, Target URL)
* Header: Optional (Required Header Format: ```CLASSIFICATION,xxx,yyy```)

```wsp2j.frequency``` - Scheduler Timings File (optional; you will be asked to provide timings in the console if the file is not present)
* Required Format ```HH mm SS```, ```hours minutes seconds```

```targets.obj``` - Targets State Space (optional; autogenerated;)
* Serialized vector of targets generated everytime the targets are refreshed.

## Output Files

```wsp2j-monitoring-YYYYmmDD-HHmmSS.txt``` - wsp2j Monitor Log (autogenerated)

## Operation Modes
Keys
```l``` - Input List File,
```o``` - Input State Space,
```t``` - Input Timings File,
```-``` - Any,
```x``` - Not Found

* ```--t``` : Timings loaded from input file
* ```--x``` : Timings loaded from console prompt
* ```lx-``` : Create and Start Mode: Creates target vector database and initiates timing scheduler
* ```xo-``` : Resume Mode: Loads target vector database from file and initiates timing scheduler
* ```lo-``` : Update and Resume Mode: Loads and updates the vector database from files and initiates timing scheduler

## Operational Details
* Initialization Sequence
   1) Scan targets and load the database into memory
   2) Load required SSH certificates (into local JDK keystore) for relevant domains (skipped if all certificates are up-to-date)
   3) Scan and load timings for the scheduler sequence
   4) Scan and load the required plugins
  
* Run Sequence
   1) Schedule single-threaded executor service to refresh target hashcodes.
   2) Trigger plugin hook if hashcode change is registered.

* Error Handling
  
  Not present; you are on your own.
